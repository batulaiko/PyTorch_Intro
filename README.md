# PyTorch_Intro
PyTorch introductory tutorial notebooks and codes. Useful for deep learing practitioners.

## Recommended Order of Study:

1. PyTorch_Tensors_Intro

Introduction to PyTorch Tensors (dimensions, broadcasting, basic linear algebra and memory operations)

2. PyTorch_Autograd_Intro

Introduction to automatic differentiation engine of PyTorch. Autograd automatically tracks the arithmetic operations and computes the derivates

3. PyTorch_Polynomial

Toy polynomial dataset and model. An example demostration of learning loops in PyTorch.

4. PyTorch_Models_Intro

Basic linear models (implemented as nn.Module).

5. PyTorch_Iris_Classification

Linear classifier model that works on tabular datasets. Toy dataset Iris is used to train the model.

6. PyTorch_FlatNet_MNIST

Image classifier model that uses flatted pixels of images. Implemented with nn.Linear, does not use any convolution layers. Trained with built-in MNIST dataset.

7. PyTorch_Conv_MNIST

Image classifier model that uses convolution layers. Trained with built-in MNIST dataset.

8. PyTorch_Conv_ImageFolder

Image classifier model that uses convolution layers. Trained with an external dataset using ImageFolder Dataset class of PyTorch.

9. PredictionUI_MNIST_FlatNet, PredictionUI_MNIST_Conv, PredictionUI_ImageFolder

Gradio UI applications for the models above. (NOTE: you need to train the models first.)

10. NLP_Intro

Basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with text preprocessing. Vectoral representations of text. Introduction to spaCy with Named entity recognition (NER) and keyword Extraction using Part of Speech (POS) (using NNP tags).

11. PyTorch_Word2Vec_CBOW

Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) implementation of Word2Vec in PyTorch.
